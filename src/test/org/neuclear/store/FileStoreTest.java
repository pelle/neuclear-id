 * Revision 1.2  2003/10/02 23:29:03  pelle
 * Updated Root Key. This will be the root key for the remainder of the beta period. With version 1.0 I will update it with a new key.
 * VerifyingTest works now and also does a pass for fake ones. Will have to think of better ways of making fake Identities to break it.
 * Cleaned up much of the tests and they all pass now.
 * The FileStoreTests need to be rethought out, by adding a test key.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2003/09/19 14:41:56  pelle
 * First import into the neuclear project. This was originally under the SF neudist
 * project. This marks a general major refactoring and renaming ahead.
 *
 * The new name for this code is NeuClear Identity and has the general package header of
 * org.neuclear.id
 * There are other areas within the current code which will be split out into other subprojects later on.
 * In particularly the signers will be completely seperated out as well as the contract types.
 *
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2003/02/10 22:30:27  pelle
 * Got rid of even further dependencies. In Particular OSCore
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2003/02/09 00:15:56  pelle

 *
 * Revision 1.1  2003/01/16 19:16:09  pelle
 * Major Structural Changes.
 * We've split the test classes out of the normal source tree, to enable Maven's test support to work.
 * WARNING
 * for Development purposes the code does not as of this commit until otherwise notified actually verifysigs.
 * We are reworking the XMLSig library and need to continue work elsewhere for the time being.
