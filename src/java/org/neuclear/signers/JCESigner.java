 * $Log: JCESigner.java,v $
 * Revision 1.2  2003/10/29 23:17:53  pelle
 * Updated some javadocs
 * Added a neuclear specific maven repository at:
 * http://neuclear.org/maven/ and updated the properties files to reflect that.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2003/10/29 21:16:28  pelle
 * Refactored the whole signing process. Now we have an interface called Signer which is the old SignerStore.
 * To use it you pass a byte array and an alias. The sign method then returns the signature.
 * If a Signer needs a passphrase it uses a PassPhraseAgent to present a dialogue box, read it from a command line etc.
 * This new Signer pattern allows us to use secure signing hardware such as N-Cipher in the future for server applications as well
 * as SmartCards for end user applications.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2003/10/28 23:44:03  pelle
 * The GuiDialogAgent now works. It simply presents itself as a simple modal dialog box asking for a passphrase.
 * The two Signer implementations both use it for the passphrase.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2003/10/21 22:29:59  pelle
 * Renamed NeudistException to NeuClearException and moved it to org.neuclear.commons where it makes more sense.
 * Unhooked the XMLException in the xmlsig library from NeuClearException to make all of its exceptions an independent hierarchy.
 * Obviously had to perform many changes throughout the code to support these changes.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2003/02/20 13:26:41  pelle
 * Adding all of the modification from Rams?s Morales ramses@computer.org to support DSASHA1 Signatures
 * Thanks Rams?s good work.
 * So this means there is now support for:
 * - DSA KeyInfo blocks
 * - DSA Key Generation within CryptoTools
 * - Signing using DSASHA1
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2003/02/18 00:03:32  pelle
 * Moved the Signer classes from neudistframework into neudist-xmlsig
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2003/02/09 00:15:55  pelle
 * Fixed things so they now compile with r_0.7 of XMLSig
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2002/10/06 00:39:26  pelle
 * I have now expanded support for different types of Signers.
 * There is now a JCESigner which uses a JCE KeyStore for signing.
 * I have refactored the SigningServlet a bit, eliminating most of the demo code.
 * This has been moved into DemoSigningServlet.
 * I have expanded the CommandLineSigner, so it now also has an option for specifying a default signing service.
 * The default web application now contains two signers.
 * - The Demo one is still at /Signer
 * - There is a new one at /personal/Signer this uses the testkeys.ks for
 * signing anything under neu://test
 * Note neu://test now has a default interactive signer running on localhost.
 * So to play with this you must install the webapp on your own local machine.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2002/09/23 15:09:11  pelle
 * Got the SimpleSigner working properly.
 * I couldn't get SealedObjects working with BouncyCastle's Symmetric keys.
 * Don't know what I was doing, so I reimplemented it. Encrypting
 * and decrypting it my self.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2002/09/21 23:11:16  pelle
 * A bunch of clean ups. Got rid of as many hard coded URL's as I could.
