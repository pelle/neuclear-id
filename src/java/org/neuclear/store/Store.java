 * $Log: Store.java,v $
 * Revision 1.12  2003/11/18 15:07:36  pelle
 * Changes to JCE Implementation
 * Working on getting all tests working including store tests
 *
 * Revision 1.11  2003/11/15 01:58:17  pelle
 * More work all around on web applications.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2003/11/11 21:18:44  pelle
 * Further vital reshuffling.
 * org.neudist.crypto.* and org.neudist.utils.* have been moved to respective areas under org.neuclear.commons
 * org.neuclear.signers.* as well as org.neuclear.passphraseagents have been moved under org.neuclear.commons.crypto as well.
 * Did a bit of work on the Canonicalizer and changed a few other minor bits.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2003/11/09 03:27:19  pelle
 * More house keeping and shuffling about mainly pay
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2003/10/21 22:31:14  pelle
 * Renamed NeudistException to NeuClearException and moved it to org.neuclear.commons where it makes more sense.
 * Unhooked the XMLException in the xmlsig library from NeuClearException to make all of its exceptions an independent hierarchy.
 * Obviously had to perform many changes throughout the code to support these changes.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2003/10/02 23:29:03  pelle
 * Updated Root Key. This will be the root key for the remainder of the beta period. With version 1.0 I will update it with a new key.
 * VerifyingTest works now and also does a pass for fake ones. Will have to think of better ways of making fake Identities to break it.
 * Cleaned up much of the tests and they all pass now.
 * The FileStoreTests need to be rethought out, by adding a test key.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2003/09/26 23:53:10  pelle
 * Changes mainly in receiver and related fun.
 * First real neuclear stuff in the payment package. Added TransferContract and AssetControllerReceiver.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2003/09/26 00:22:07  pelle
 * Cleanups and final changes to code for refactoring of the Verifier and Reader part.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2003/09/24 23:56:49  pelle
 * Refactoring nearly done. New model for creating signed objects.
 * With view for supporting the xmlpull api shortly for performance reasons.
 * Currently still uses dom4j but that has been refactored out that it
 * should now be very quick to implement a xmlpull implementation.
 *
 * A side benefit of this is that the API has been further simplified. I still have some work
 * todo with regards to cleaning up some of the outlying parts of the code.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2003/09/23 19:16:29  pelle
 * Changed NameSpace to Identity.
 * To cause less confusion in the future.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2003/09/22 19:24:02  pelle
 * More fixes throughout to problems caused by renaming.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2003/09/19 14:41:16  pelle
 * First import into the neuclear project. This was originally under the SF neuclear
 * project. This marks a general major refactoring and renaming ahead.
 *
 * The new name for this code is NeuClear Identity and has the general package header of
 * org.neuclear.id
 * There are other areas within the current code which will be split out into other subprojects later on.
 * In particularly the signers will be completely seperated out as well as the contract types.
 *
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2003/02/18 14:57:35  pelle
 * Finished Cleaning up Receivers and Stores.
 * Also updated nsdl.xsd xml schema with latest changes.
 * The whole API is now very simple.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2003/02/14 05:10:13  pelle
 * New Source model is implemented.
 * It doesnt quite verify things correctly yet. I'm not yet sure why.
 * CommandLineSigner is simplified to make it easier to use.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2003/02/09 00:15:55  pelle
 * Fixed things so they now compile with r_0.7 of XMLSig
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2003/01/16 22:20:02  pelle
 * First Draft of new generalised Ledger Interface.
 * Currently we have a Book and Transaction class.
 * We also need a Ledger class and a Ledger Factory.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2002/12/17 21:41:00  pelle
 * First part of refactoring of SignedNamedObject and SignedObject Interface/Class parings.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2002/12/17 20:34:42  pelle
 * Lots of changes to core functionality.
 * First of all I've refactored most of the Resolving and verification code. I have a few more things to do
 * on it before I'm happy.
 * There is now a NSResolver class, which handles all the namespace resolution. I took most of the functionality
 * for this out of SignedNamedObject.
 * Then there is the veriifer, which verifies a given SignedNamedObject using the NSResolver.
 * This has simplified the SignedNamedObject classes drastically, leaving them as mainly data objects, which is what they
 * should be.
 * I have also gone around and tightened up security on many different classes, making clases and/or methods final where appropriate.
 * NSCache now operates using http://www.waterken.com's fantastic ADT collections library.
 * Something important has been added, which is a SignRequest named object. This signed object, embeds an unsigned
 * named object for signing by an end users' signing service.
 * Now were almost ready to start seriously implementing AssetIssuers and Transfers, which will be the most important
 * part of the framework.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2002/10/02 21:03:45  pelle
 * Major Commit
 * I completely redid the namespace resolving code.
 * It now works correctly with the new store attribute of the namespace
 * And can correctly work out the location of a namespace file
 * by hierarchically signing it.
 * I have also included several top level namespaces and finalised
 * the root namespace.
 * In short all of the above means that we can theoretically call
 * Neubia live now. (Well on my first deployment anyway).
 * There is a new CommandLineSigner utility class which creates and signs
 * namespaces using standard java keystores.
 * I'm now working on updating the documentation, so other people
 * than me might have a chance at using it.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2002/09/21 23:11:16  pelle
 * A bunch of clean ups. Got rid of as many hard coded URL's as I could.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2002/09/18 10:55:55  pelle
 * First release in new CVS structure.
 * Also first public release.
 * This implemnts simple named objects.
 * - Identity Objects
 * - NSAuth Objects
 *
 * Storage systems
 * - In Memory Storage
 * - Clear text file based storage
 * - Encrypted File Storage (with SHA256 digested filenames)
 * - CachedStorage
 * - SoapStorage
 *
 * Simple SOAP client/server
 * - Simple Single method call SOAP client, for arbitrary dom4j based requests
 * - Simple Abstract SOAP Servlet for implementing http based SOAP Servers
 *
 * Simple XML-Signature Implementation
 * - Based on dom4j
 * - SHA-RSA only
 * - Very simple (likely imperfect) highspeed canonicalizer
 * - Zero support for X509 (We dont like that anyway)
 * - Super Simple
 *
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2002/06/18 03:04:11  pelle
 * Just added all the necessary jars.
 * Fixed a few things in the framework and
 * started a GUI Application to manage Neu's.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2002/06/05 23:42:05  pelle
 * The Throw clauses of several method definitions were getting out of hand, so I have
 * added a new wrapper exception NeuClearException, to keep things clean in the ledger.
 * This is used as a catchall wrapper for all Exceptions in the underlying API's such as IOExceptions,
 * XML Exceptions etc.
 * You can catch any Exception and rethrow it using Utility.rethrowException(e) as a quick way of handling
 * exceptions.
 * Otherwise the Store framework and the NameSpaces are really comming along quite well. I added a CachedStore
 * which wraps around any other Store and caches the access to the store.
