Revision 1.4  2003/11/19 23:33:59  pelle
Signers now can generatekeys via the generateKey() method.
Refactored the relationship between SignedNamedObject and NamedObjectBuilder a bit.
SignedNamedObject now contains the full xml which is returned with getEncoded()
This means that it is now possible to further send on or process a SignedNamedObject, leaving
NamedObjectBuilder for its original purposes of purely generating new Contracts.
NamedObjectBuilder.sign() now returns a SignedNamedObject which is the prefered way of processing it.
Updated all major interfaces that used the old model to use the new model.

Revision 1.3  2003/11/11 21:18:43  pelle
Further vital reshuffling.
org.neudist.crypto.* and org.neudist.utils.* have been moved to respective areas under org.neuclear.commons
org.neuclear.signers.* as well as org.neuclear.passphraseagents have been moved under org.neuclear.commons.crypto as well.
Did a bit of work on the Canonicalizer and changed a few other minor bits.

Revision 1.2  2003/10/21 22:31:13  pelle
Renamed NeudistException to NeuClearException and moved it to org.neuclear.commons where it makes more sense.
Unhooked the XMLException in the xmlsig library from NeuClearException to make all of its exceptions an independent hierarchy.
Obviously had to perform many changes throughout the code to support these changes.

Revision 1.1  2003/09/24 23:56:48  pelle
Refactoring nearly done. New model for creating signed objects.
With view for supporting the xmlpull api shortly for performance reasons.
Currently still uses dom4j but that has been refactored out that it
should now be very quick to implement a xmlpull implementation.

A side benefit of this is that the API has been further simplified. I still have some work
todo with regards to cleaning up some of the outlying parts of the code.
