 * $Log: SignedNamedObject.java,v $
 * Revision 1.17  2004/01/10 00:03:21  pelle
 * Implemented new Schema for Transfer*
 * Working on it for Exchange*, so far all Receipts are implemented.
 * Added SignedNamedDocument which is a generic SignedNamedObject that works with all Signed XML.
 * Changed SignedNamedObject.getDigest() from byte array to String.
 * The whole malarchy in neuclear-pay does not build yet. The refactoring is a big job, but getting there.
 *
 * Revision 1.16  2004/01/08 23:39:06  pelle
 * XMLSignature can now give you the Signing key and the id of the signer.
 * SignedElement can now self verify using embedded public keys as well as KeyName's
 * Added NeuclearKeyResolver for resolving public key's from Identity certificates.
 * SignedNamedObjects can now generate their own name using the following format:
 * neu:sha1://[sha1 of PublicKey]![sha1 of full signed object]
 * The resulting object has a special internally generted Identity containing the PublicKey
 * Identity can now contain nothing but a public key
 *
 * Revision 1.15  2003/12/20 00:21:19  pelle
 * overwrote the standard Object.toString(), hashCode() and equals() methods for SignedNamedObject/Core
 * fixed cactus tests
 * Added TransferRequestServlet
 * Added cactus tests to pay
 *
 * Revision 1.14  2003/12/19 18:03:34  pelle
 * Revamped a lot of exception handling throughout the framework, it has been simplified in most places:
 * - For most cases the main exception to worry about now is InvalidNamedObjectException.
 * - Most lowerlevel exception that cant be handled meaningful are now wrapped in the LowLevelException, a
 *   runtime exception.
 * - Source and Store patterns each now have their own exceptions that generalizes the various physical
 *   exceptions that can happen in that area.
 *
 * Revision 1.13  2003/12/10 23:58:51  pelle
 * Did some cleaning up in the builders
 * Fixed some stuff in IdentityCreator
 * New maven goal to create executable jarapp
 * We are close to 0.8 final of ID, 0.11 final of XMLSIG and 0.5 of commons.
 * Will release shortly.
 *
 * Revision 1.12  2003/11/21 04:45:13  pelle
 * EncryptedFileStore now works. It uses the PBECipher with DES3 afair.
 * Otherwise You will Finaliate.
 * Anything that can be final has been made final throughout everyting. We've used IDEA's Inspector tool to find all instance of variables that could be final.
 * This should hopefully make everything more stable (and secure).
 *
 * Revision 1.11  2003/11/20 16:01:25  pelle
 * Did a security review of the basic Verification process and needed to make changes.
 * I've introduced the SignedNamedCore which all subclasses of SignedNamedObject need to include in their constructor.
 * What does this mean?
 * It means that all subclasses of SignedNamedObject have a guaranteed "signed final ticket" that can only be created in one place.
 * This also simplifies the constructors as well as the NamedObjectReaders.
 * I've gone through making everything in these contracts that is possible final. Thus further ensuring the security.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2003/11/19 23:33:59  pelle
 * Signers now can generatekeys via the generateKey() method.
 * Refactored the relationship between SignedNamedObject and NamedObjectBuilder a bit.
 * SignedNamedObject now contains the full xml which is returned with getEncoded()
 * This means that it is now possible to further receive on or process a SignedNamedObject, leaving
 * NamedObjectBuilder for its original purposes of purely generating new Contracts.
 * NamedObjectBuilder.sign() now returns a SignedNamedObject which is the prefered way of processing it.
 * Updated all major interfaces that used the old model to use the new model.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2003/11/11 21:18:43  pelle
 * Further vital reshuffling.
 * org.neudist.crypto.* and org.neudist.utils.* have been moved to respective areas under org.neuclear.commons
 * org.neuclear.signers.* as well as org.neuclear.passphraseagents have been moved under org.neuclear.commons.crypto as well.
 * Did a bit of work on the Canonicalizer and changed a few other minor bits.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2003/11/10 21:08:49  pelle
 * More JavaDoc
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2003/10/25 00:39:54  pelle
 * Fixed SmtpSender it now sends the messages.
 * Refactored CommandLineSigner. Now it simply signs files read from command line. However new class IdentityCreator
 * is subclassed and creates new Identities. You can subclass CommandLineSigner to create your own variants.
 * Several problems with configuration. Trying to solve at the moment. Updated PicoContainer to beta-2
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2003/10/21 22:31:13  pelle
 * Renamed NeudistException to NeuClearException and moved it to org.neuclear.commons where it makes more sense.
 * Unhooked the XMLException in the xmlsig library from NeuClearException to make all of its exceptions an independent hierarchy.
 * Obviously had to perform many changes throughout the code to support these changes.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2003/10/01 19:08:31  pelle
 * Changed XML Format. Now NameSpace has been modified to Identity also the
 * xml namespace prefix nsdl has been changed to neuid.
 * The standard constants for using these have been moved into NSTools.
 * The NamedObjectBuilder can also now take an Element, such as an unsigned template.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2003/10/01 17:05:37  pelle
 * Moved the NeuClearCertificate class to be an inner class of Identity.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2003/09/30 23:25:14  pelle
 * Added new JCE Provider and java Certificate implementation for NeuClear Identity.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2003/09/29 23:17:31  pelle
 * Changes to the senders. Now the senders only work with NamedObjectBuilders
 * which are the only NamedObject representations that contain full XML.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2003/09/24 23:56:48  pelle
 * Refactoring nearly done. New model for creating signed objects.
 * With view for supporting the xmlpull api shortly for performance reasons.
 * Currently still uses dom4j but that has been refactored out that it
 * should now be very quick to implement a xmlpull implementation.
 *
 * A side benefit of this is that the API has been further simplified. I still have some work
 * todo with regards to cleaning up some of the outlying parts of the code.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2003/09/23 19:16:27  pelle
 * Changed NameSpace to Identity.
 * To cause less confusion in the future.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2003/09/22 19:24:01  pelle
 * More fixes throughout to problems caused by renaming.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2003/09/19 14:41:03  pelle
 * First import into the neuclear project. This was originally under the SF neuclear
 * project. This marks a general major refactoring and renaming ahead.
 *
 * The new name for this code is NeuClear Identity and has the general package header of
 * org.neuclear.id
 * There are other areas within the current code which will be split out into other subprojects later on.
 * In particularly the signers will be completely seperated out as well as the contract types.
 *
 *
 * Revision 1.13  2003/02/18 14:57:19  pelle
 * Finished Cleaning up Receivers and Stores.
 * Also updated nsdl.xsd xml schema with latest changes.
 * The whole API is now very simple.
 *
 * Revision 1.12  2003/02/14 21:10:30  pelle
 * The email sender works. The LogSender and the SoapSender should work but havent been tested yet.
 * The SignedNamedObject has a new log() method that logs it's contents at it's parent Identity's logger.
 * The Identity object also has a new method receive() which allows one to receive a named object to the Identity's
 * default receiver.
 *
 * Revision 1.11  2003/02/14 14:04:29  pelle
 * The New Source Classes work and NS resolution works as well.
 * I've renamed Target to TargetReference to prepare for the other main refactoring ahead. Implementation of
 * Senders.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2003/02/10 22:30:06  pelle
 * Got rid of even further dependencies. In Particular OSCore
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2003/02/09 00:15:52  pelle
 * Fixed things so they now compile with r_0.7 of XMLSig
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2002/12/17 21:53:28  pelle
 * Final changes for refactoring.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2002/12/17 20:34:39  pelle
 * Lots of changes to core functionality.
 * First of all I've refactored most of the Resolving and verification code. I have a few more things to do
 * on it before I'm happy.
 * There is now a NSResolver class, which handles all the namespace resolution. I took most of the functionality
 * for this out of SignedNamedObject.
 * Then there is the veriifer, which verifies a given SignedNamedObject using the NSResolver.
 * This has simplified the SignedNamedObject classes drastically, leaving them as mainly data objects, which is what they
 * should be.
 * I have also gone around and tightened up security on many different classes, making clases and/or methods final where appropriate.
 * NSCache now operates using http://www.waterken.com's fantastic ADT collections library.
 * Something important has been added, which is a SignRequest named object. This signed object, embeds an unsigned
 * named object for signing by an end users' signing service.
 * Now were almost ready to start seriously implementing AssetIssuers and Transfers, which will be the most important
 * part of the framework.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2002/10/03 01:51:58  pelle
 * Bunch of smaller fixes for bugs found during deployment.
 * Also a bit more documentation.
 * I'm happy with this being called rev. 0.4
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2002/10/02 21:03:44  pelle
 * Major Commit
 * I completely redid the namespace resolving code.
 * It now works correctly with the new store attribute of the namespace
 * And can correctly work out the location of a namespace file
 * by hierarchically signing it.
 * I have also included several top level namespaces and finalised
 * the root namespace.
 * In short all of the above means that we can theoretically call
 * Neubia live now. (Well on my first deployment anyway).
 * There is a new CommandLineSigner utility class which creates and signs
 * namespaces using standard java keystores.
 * I'm now working on updating the documentation, so other people
 * than me might have a chance at using it.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2002/09/25 19:20:15  pelle
 * Added various new schemas and updated most of the existing ones.
 * Added explanation interface for explaining the purpose of a
 * SignedNamedObject to a user. We may want to use XSL instead.
 * Also made the signing webapp look a bit nicer.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2002/09/21 23:11:13  pelle
 * A bunch of clean ups. Got rid of as many hard coded URL's as I could.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2002/09/20 01:15:18  pelle
 * Added prototype webapplication under src/java
 * SOAPServlet appears to work
 * Any webservices taking named objects should subclass from ReceiverServlet
 * SigningServlet is not completely working right now, but
 * will be the main prototype of a web based signer.
 *
 * Other new features are GenericNamedObject for simple instantiation of
 * arbitrary named objects.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2002/09/18 10:55:40  pelle
 * First release in new CVS structure.
 * Also first public release.
 * This implemnts simple named objects.
 * - Identity Objects
 * - NSAuth Objects
 *
 * Storage systems
 * - In Memory Storage
 * - Clear text file based storage
 * - Encrypted File Storage (with SHA256 digested filenames)
 * - CachedStorage
 * - SoapStorage
 *
 * Simple SOAP client/server
 * - Simple Single method call SOAP client, for arbitrary dom4j based requests
 * - Simple Abstract SOAP Servlet for implementing http based SOAP Servers
 *
 * Simple XML-Signature Implementation
 * - Based on dom4j
 * - SHA-RSA only
 * - Very simple (likely imperfect) highspeed canonicalizer
 * - Zero support for X509 (We dont like that anyway)
 * - Super Simple
 *
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2002/05/29 10:02:22  pelle
 * Lets try one more time. This is the first rev of the next gen of Neudist
