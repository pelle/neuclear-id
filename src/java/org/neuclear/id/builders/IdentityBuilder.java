 * $Log: IdentityBuilder.java,v $
 * Revision 1.5  2003/10/29 21:16:27  pelle
 * Refactored the whole signing process. Now we have an interface called Signer which is the old SignerStore.
 * To use it you pass a byte array and an alias. The sign method then returns the signature.
 * If a Signer needs a passphrase it uses a PassPhraseAgent to present a dialogue box, read it from a command line etc.
 * This new Signer pattern allows us to use secure signing hardware such as N-Cipher in the future for server applications as well
 * as SmartCards for end user applications.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2003/10/21 22:31:12  pelle
 * Renamed NeudistException to NeuClearException and moved it to org.neuclear.commons where it makes more sense.
 * Unhooked the XMLException in the xmlsig library from NeuClearException to make all of its exceptions an independent hierarchy.
 * Obviously had to perform many changes throughout the code to support these changes.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2003/10/02 23:29:03  pelle
 * Updated Root Key. This will be the root key for the remainder of the beta period. With version 1.0 I will update it with a new key.
 * VerifyingTest works now and also does a pass for fake ones. Will have to think of better ways of making fake Identities to break it.
 * Cleaned up much of the tests and they all pass now.
 * The FileStoreTests need to be rethought out, by adding a test key.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2003/10/01 19:08:30  pelle
 * Changed XML Format. Now NameSpace has been modified to Identity also the
 * xml namespace prefix nsdl has been changed to neuid.
 * The standard constants for using these have been moved into NSTools.
 * The NamedObjectBuilder can also now take an Element, such as an unsigned template.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2003/09/27 19:23:11  pelle
 * Added Builders to create named objects from scratch.
 *
 * Revision 1.11  2003/02/18 14:57:18  pelle
 * Finished Cleaning up Receivers and Stores.
 * Also updated nsdl.xsd xml schema with latest changes.
 * The whole API is now very simple.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2003/02/18 00:06:15  pelle
 * Moved the Signer's into xml-sig
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2003/02/16 00:22:59  pelle
 * LogSender now works and there is a corresponding server side cgi script to do the logging in
 * http://neudist.org/logger/ Site is not yet up but will be soon.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2003/02/14 21:10:29  pelle
 * The email sender works. The LogSender and the SoapSender should work but havent been tested yet.
 * The NamedObject has a new log() method that logs it's contents at it's parent NameSpace's logger.
 * The NameSpace object also has a new method send() which allows one to send a named object to the NameSpace's
 * default receiver.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2003/02/10 22:30:05  pelle
 * Got rid of even further dependencies. In Particular OSCore
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2003/02/09 00:15:52  pelle
 * Fixed things so they now compile with r_0.7 of XMLSig
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2003/01/16 22:20:02  pelle
 * First Draft of new generalised Ledger Interface.
 * Currently we have a Book and Transaction class.
 * We also need a Ledger class and a Ledger Factory.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2002/12/17 21:40:54  pelle
 * First part of refactoring of NamedObject and SignedObject Interface/Class parings.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2002/12/17 20:34:39  pelle
 * Lots of changes to core functionality.
 * First of all I've refactored most of the Resolving and verification code. I have a few more things to do
 * on it before I'm happy.
 * There is now a NSResolver class, which handles all the namespace resolution. I took most of the functionality
 * for this out of NamedObject.
 * Then there is the veriifer, which verifies a given NamedObject using the NSResolver.
 * This has simplified the NamedObject classes drastically, leaving them as mainly data objects, which is what they
 * should be.
 * I have also gone around and tightened up security on many different classes, making clases and/or methods final where appropriate.
 * NSCache now operates using http://www.waterken.com's fantastic ADT collections library.
 * Something important has been added, which is a SignRequest named object. This signed object, embeds an unsigned
 * named object for signing by an end users' signing service.
 * Now were almost ready to start seriously implementing AssetIssuers and Transfers, which will be the most important
 * part of the framework.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2002/10/02 21:03:44  pelle
 * Major Commit
 * I completely redid the namespace resolving code.
 * It now works correctly with the new store attribute of the namespace
 * And can correctly work out the location of a namespace file
 * by hierarchically signing it.
 * I have also included several top level namespaces and finalised
 * the root namespace.
 * In short all of the above means that we can theoretically call
 * Neubia live now. (Well on my first deployment anyway).
 * There is a new CommandLineSigner utility class which creates and signs
 * namespaces using standard java keystores.
 * I'm now working on updating the documentation, so other people
 * than me might have a chance at using it.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2002/09/18 10:55:42  pelle
 * First release in new CVS structure.
 * Also first public release.
 * This implemnts simple named objects.
 * - NameSpace Objects
 * - NSAuth Objects
 *
 * Storage systems
 * - In Memory Storage
 * - Clear text file based storage
 * - Encrypted File Storage (with SHA256 digested filenames)
 * - CachedStorage
 * - SoapStorage
 *
 * Simple SOAP client/server
 * - Simple Single method call SOAP client, for arbitrary dom4j based requests
 * - Simple Abstract SOAP Servlet for implementing http based SOAP Servers
 *
 * Simple XML-Signature Implementation
 * - Based on dom4j
 * - SHA-RSA only
 * - Very simple (likely imperfect) highspeed canonicalizer
 * - Zero support for X509 (We dont like that anyway)
 * - Super Simple
 *
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2002/06/18 03:04:11  pelle
 * Just added all the necessary jars.
 * Fixed a few things in the framework and
 * started a GUI Application to manage Neu's.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2002/06/17 20:48:33  pelle
 * The NS functionality should now work. FileStore is working properly.
 * The example .ns objects in the neuspace folder have been updated with the
 * latest version of the format.
 * "neuspace/root.ns" should now be considered the universal parent of the
 * neudist system.
 * Still more to go, but we're getting there. I will now focus on a quick
 * Web interface. After which Contracts will be added.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2002/06/13 19:04:07  pelle
 * A start to a web interface into the architecture.
 * We're getting a bit further now with functionality.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2002/06/05 23:42:04  pelle
 * The Throw clauses of several method definitions were getting out of hand, so I have
 * added a new wrapper exception NeuClearException, to keep things clean in the ledger.
 * This is used as a catchall wrapper for all Exceptions in the underlying API's such as IOExceptions,
 * XML Exceptions etc.
 * You can catch any Exception and rethrow it using Utility.rethrowException(e) as a quick way of handling
 * exceptions.
 * Otherwise the Store framework and the NameSpaces are really comming along quite well. I added a CachedStore
 * which wraps around any other Store and caches the access to the store.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2002/05/29 10:02:22  pelle
 * Lets try one more time. This is the first rev of the next gen of Neudist
