 * $Log: SmtpSender.java,v $
 * Revision 1.1  2004/03/02 18:59:10  pelle
 * Further cleanups in neuclear-id. Moved everything under id.
 *
 * Revision 1.17  2004/02/18 00:14:33  pelle
 * Many, many clean ups. I've readded Targets in a new method.
 * Gotten rid of NamedObjectBuilder and revamped Identity and Resolvers
 *
 * Revision 1.16  2003/12/16 15:05:00  pelle
 * Added SignedMessage contract for signing simple textual contracts.
 * Added NeuSender, updated SmtpSender and Sender to take plain email addresses (without the mailto:)
 * Added AbstractObjectCreationTest to make it quicker to write unit tests to verify
 * NamedObjectBuilder/SignedNamedObject Pairs.
 * Sample application has been expanded with a basic email application.
 * Updated docs for sample web app.
 * Added missing LGPL LICENSE.txt files to signer and sample app
 *
 * Revision 1.15  2003/12/10 23:58:52  pelle
 * Did some cleaning up in the builders
 * Fixed some stuff in IdentityCreator
 * New maven goal to create executable jarapp
 * We are close to 0.8 final of ID, 0.11 final of XMLSIG and 0.5 of commons.
 * Will release shortly.
 *
 * Revision 1.14  2003/11/21 04:45:13  pelle
 * EncryptedFileStore now works. It uses the PBECipher with DES3 afair.
 * Otherwise You will Finaliate.
 * Anything that can be final has been made final throughout everyting. We've used IDEA's Inspector tool to find all instance of variables that could be final.
 * This should hopefully make everything more stable (and secure).
 *
 * Revision 1.13  2003/11/19 23:33:59  pelle
 * Signers now can generatekeys via the generateKey() method.
 * Refactored the relationship between SignedNamedObject and NamedObjectBuilder a bit.
 * SignedNamedObject now contains the full xml which is returned with getEncoded()
 * This means that it is now possible to further receive on or process a SignedNamedObject, leaving
 * NamedObjectBuilder for its original purposes of purely generating new Contracts.
 * NamedObjectBuilder.sign() now returns a SignedNamedObject which is the prefered way of processing it.
 * Updated all major interfaces that used the old model to use the new model.
 *
 * Revision 1.12  2003/11/11 21:18:43  pelle
 * Further vital reshuffling.
 * org.neudist.crypto.* and org.neudist.utils.* have been moved to respective areas under org.neuclear.commons
 * org.neuclear.signers.* as well as org.neuclear.passphraseagents have been moved under org.neuclear.commons.crypto as well.
 * Did a bit of work on the Canonicalizer and changed a few other minor bits.
 *
 * Revision 1.11  2003/11/10 17:42:36  pelle
 * The AssetController interface has been more or less finalized.
 * CurrencyController fully implemented
 * AssetControlClient implementes a remote client for communicating with AssetControllers
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2003/11/08 01:40:53  pelle
 * WARNING this rev is majorly unstable and will almost certainly not compile.
 * More major refactoring in neuclear-pay.
 * Got rid of neuclear-ledger like features of pay such as Account and Issuer.
 * Accounts have been replaced by Identity from neuclear-id
 * Issuer is now Asset which is a subclass of Identity
 * AssetController supports more than one Asset. Which is important for most non ecurrency implementations.
 * TransferRequest/Receipt and its Held companions are now SignedNamedObjects. Thus to create them you must use
 * their matching TransferRequest/ReceiptBuilder classes.
 * PaymentProcessor has been renamed CurrencyController. I will extract a superclass later to be named AbstractLedgerController
 * which will handle all neuclear-ledger based AssetControllers.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2003/11/06 23:48:59  pelle
 * Major Refactoring of CurrencyController.
 * Factored out AssetController to be new abstract parent class together with most of its support classes.
 * Created (Half way) AssetControlClient, which can perform transactions on external AssetControllers via NeuClear.
 * Created the first attempt at the ExchangeAgent. This will need use of the AssetControlClient.
 * SOAPTools was changed to return a stream. This is required by the VerifyingReader in NeuClear.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2003/10/25 00:39:54  pelle
 * Fixed SmtpSender it now sends the messages.
 * Refactored CommandLineSigner. Now it simply signs files read from command line. However new class IdentityCreator
 * is subclassed and creates new Identities. You can subclass CommandLineSigner to create your own variants.
 * Several problems with configuration. Trying to solve at the moment. Updated PicoContainer to beta-2
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2003/10/21 22:31:13  pelle
 * Renamed NeudistException to NeuClearException and moved it to org.neuclear.commons where it makes more sense.
 * Unhooked the XMLException in the xmlsig library from NeuClearException to make all of its exceptions an independent hierarchy.
 * Obviously had to perform many changes throughout the code to support these changes.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2003/09/29 23:17:32  pelle
 * Changes to the senders. Now the senders only work with NamedObjectBuilders
 * which are the only NamedObject representations that contain full XML.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2003/09/26 00:22:07  pelle
 * Cleanups and final changes to code for refactoring of the Verifier and Reader part.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2003/09/24 23:56:48  pelle
 * Refactoring nearly done. New model for creating signed objects.
 * With view for supporting the xmlpull api shortly for performance reasons.
 * Currently still uses dom4j but that has been refactored out that it
 * should now be very quick to implement a xmlpull implementation.
 *
 * A side benefit of this is that the API has been further simplified. I still have some work
 * todo with regards to cleaning up some of the outlying parts of the code.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2003/09/23 19:16:28  pelle
 * Changed NameSpace to Identity.
 * To cause less confusion in the future.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2003/09/22 19:24:02  pelle
 * More fixes throughout to problems caused by renaming.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2003/09/19 14:41:29  pelle
 * First import into the neuclear project. This was originally under the SF neuclear
 * project. This marks a general major refactoring and renaming ahead.
 *
 * The new name for this code is NeuClear Identity and has the general package header of
 * org.neuclear.id
 * There are other areas within the current code which will be split out into other subprojects later on.
 * In particularly the signers will be completely seperated out as well as the contract types.
 *
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2003/02/14 21:10:35  pelle
 * The email sender works. The LogSender and the SoapSender should work but havent been tested yet.
 * The SignedNamedObject has a new log() method that logs it's contents at it's parent Identity's logger.
 * The Identity object also has a new method receive() which allows one to receive a named object to the Identity's
 * default receiver.
