		<section name="Simplifying Identity">
            <p>
                If you believe most vendors selling Identity software, Identity is all about identifying the national ID
                number of the person who is clicking the mouse that links to your web site. This means that the relatively
                simple concept of verifying the person who logs in as "misterwhammo" to your web site as the same person
                who buys the t-shirt you are selling is made difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="http://neuclear.org/id/">NeuClear ID</a> aims to cut the <i>Real World</i> aspect of Identity out
                of the core feature of online identity and makes it an optional extra. NeuClear presents Identity as a set
                of simple id's that your average user can easily setup and understand:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    neu://superbux
                </li>
                <li>neu://pelle@super</li>

            </ul>

        <section name="Hierarchical">
            One of the largest problems with DNS is its Hierarchical nature. However that is also one of its best features.
            It makes it easy to understand. We have taken the hierarchical nature of it and taken away the main problem of
            a central point of failure.
