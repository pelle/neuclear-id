                The Scope of NeuDist as a whole is pretty big. Many parts of it would also be of use outside of the whole NeuDist Framework.
                Therefore we're starting to split NeuDist into several smaller easier to manage and comprehed sub projects.

            <p>
                <a href="/xmlsig/index.html">NeuDist-XMLSig</a> is a XML Signature API is a simple implementation of the XML-Signature standard from <a href="http://www.w3c.org">W3C</a>.
                The main difference of this over Apache's implementation is that it uses Dom4J and hopefully should be faster. This has never been verified
                so take it with a grain of salt.
