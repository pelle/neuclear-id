            <p>
                To build the NeuClear framework you first need to install
                <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>.
                Follow their installation instructions and you should be ok. I haven't tried this under windows yet, but I'm guessing
                it should work fine. Maven fetches all the required libraries you need the first time you attempt to build it. There are however
                two required libraries that are not yet part of their central repository. Some of the required libraries are not in maven's own repositories,
                we have our own maven repository at http://neuclear.org/maven/ and the project is setup to get all the latest from there.
            </p>
            <p>
                Simply unpack it in mavens home directory retaining the directory structure and you should be allright.

                Unpack the source and binary distributions. Familiarise yourself a bit with maven. It's a bit different than ant, but
                very easy to learn. To see the options available go to the type:
            </p>
            <source>~/projects/neuclear-id> maven -g</source>
            <p>
                Of these the most important one is to simply type:
            </p>
            <source>~/projects/neuclear-id> maven war</source>
            <p>
                This should build everything and create a neuclear-id.war file in
                <tt>target/</tt>. You can then deploy
                this war file in your J2EE compliant servlet engine. eg. place it in tomcat or jetty's
                <tt>webapps/</tt> directory
                and restart.
