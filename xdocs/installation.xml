                To build the NeuDist framework you first need to install <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/maven/">Maven</a>.
                Follow their installation instructions and you should be ok. I haven't tried this under windows yet, but I'm guessing
                it should work fine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maven fetches almost all the required libraries you need the first time you attempt to build it. There are however
                two required libraries that are not yet part of their central repository. You will need to download these yourself and
                install it into Maven's local repository. For your convenience we've <a href="downloads/reqlibs.tar.gz">packaged them up here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Simply unpack it in mavens home directory retaining the directory structure and you should be allright.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to get them yourself. Get the latest version of <a href="http://www.opensymphony.org">OSCore</a> and
                <a href="http://www.bouncycastle.org">Bouncy Castle Crypto</a>. For Bouncy Castle Crypto you need a JCE and a provider.
                If you're using JDK1.4 you will allready have a JCE. Otherwise the easiest thing todo is to get their combined JCE/Provider.
                I would also recommend getting the signed jar for your version of the JDK and install it as an extension in
                <tt>$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext</tt>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember to edit your <tt>$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security</tt> file as well. Adding the following line:
            </p>
            <source>
security.provider.6=org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider
            </source>
            <p>Making sure to change the 6 to whatever the last number is in the sequence of providers</p>
            <p>
                In Addition to play around with it you will need a J2EE compliant servlet engine such as <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Jakarta Tomcat</a>
                or <a href="http://jetty.mortbay.org">Jetty</a>. Install this as required.

                Unpack the source and binary distributions. Familiarise yourself a bit with maven. It's a bit different than ant, but
                very easy to learn. To see the options available go to the type:
            </p>
            <source>~/projects/neudistframework> maven -g</source>
            <p>
                Of these the most important one is to simply type:
            </p>
            <source>~/projects/neudistframework> maven war</source>
            <p>
                This should build everything and create a neudistframework.war file in <tt>target/</tt>. You can then deploy
                this war file in your J2EE compliant servlet engine. eg. place it in tomcat or jetty's <tt>webapps/</tt> directory
                and restart.
