				NeuDist is an Open Source software framework written to support the Neubia project for Distributed Transaction Clearing. The initial version is
                written in Java, but we do hope to also provide .NET CLR, Perl and Python implentations of the core functionality soon.

            <p>
                The framework will be available to support a wide variety of multi layered financial and non-financial applications. Examples of applications include
                User Authentication, Payments, Auctions, Exchanges, Financial Instruments (Options, Bonds etc). The same basic framework provides the core functionality
                of assurance, authentication and trust for all of these applications. Leaving developers to worry only about the front end functionality of their application.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Core technology is based on XML. With heavy use of the new XML-Signature standard to handle trust and security aspects of the framework.
                We implement a new simple to use PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) to base this trust upon. Communication is done primarily using SOAP.
