				NeuClear is an umbrella project to create various technologies to enable a truely distributed future of
                electronic commerce. The NeuClear ID project is a new simplified PKI system to help try to enable the kinds
                applications that people have been talking about the last 10 years, but never got of the ground due to
                usability and logistical reasons.

                We are working on expanding our documentation now. Besides expanding our <a href="apidocs/index.html">API Documentation</a>,
                we also now have a <a href="bdg.html">busy developers guide</a>. Aimed to get developers started with their own Identities
                quickly and easily.

            <p>
                The current development version is 0.8-SNAPSHOT. Our aim for 0.8 FINAL is to stabilize and freeze the API.
                Thus the goal is to acheive usability for application developers. This should be reached in mid December 2003.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our aim for the next version 0.9 is to stabilize and freeze the underlying xml formats and standards as well
                as to create more userland tools. Thus the goal is to fix the underlying format making it easier for other implementations
                of NeuClear ID. This should be reached early on in January 2004
            </p>
            <p>
                Our goal is for 1.0 the following release to be fairly polished from a usability standpoint. Our goal is to release this
                in February 2004.
